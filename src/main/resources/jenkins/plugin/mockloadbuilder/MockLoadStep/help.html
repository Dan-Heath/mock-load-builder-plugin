<div>
    Generates load on the Jenkins build node and over the remoting channel. There will be a random number of build
    artifacts created matching the file name pattern <code>mock-artifact-*.txt</code>. There will be a JUnit test
    report with the file name <code>mock-junit.xml</code>. Approximately 5% of the time, the build will "fail" its
    tests and thus no artifacts will be generated.
